# Rob's 2023 Blog

This is a repo for me to experiment with Deno, TypeScript and React. There will
be a _lot_ of messy code in here, and plenty of examples of what not to do, but
it's very much designed for experimenting.

For more chaos as I go along, follow me on
[@robl@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@robl).
